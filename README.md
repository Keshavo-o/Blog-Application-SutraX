# SutraX - Blogging Application

SutraX is a **Blogging Application** built using **Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS**.  
It allows users to **sign up, log in, create blogs, comment, and upload profile/blog images**.  
This project follows a **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern with proper folder structuring.

## Why the name - SutraX üòÖ?
The name ‚ÄúSutraX‚Äù is inspired by the word ‚ÄúSutra‚Äù, which in Sanskrit means a thread or guiding rule‚Äîsomething that connects ideas and knowledge together. Since this application is about blogging and sharing thoughts, it acts like a digital thread that ties together stories, experiences, and perspectives.
