There are a few things you need to keep in mind while uploading on AWS
1.) Change PORT to environment variables as on cloud there are many ports running and overlapping so we cant define a specific port number by ourselves
    I cant hardcode PORT number , server will provide at runtime so we need to use it as dynammic variables 
    Environment variables: set by cloud
        ie : In your console if you "export myname=Keshav"
             an environment variable is created as myname . 
             you can access it as process.env.myname
        process.env.PORT is provided by cloud
2.) same thing with MOngo DB link
    as process.env.MONGO_URL
3.) Make sure your scripts have start script in in package.json>scripts
4.) index.js (the main file) should be renamed as app.js everywhre in package also
5.) You can also create a .env local file to give local variables there
     But you need to install a package to make it run : npm install dotenv
     And in app .js acquiring the package as : require("dotenv").config(); (ON TOP)
6.) NOW GO TO console.aws.com and can proceed further:
    You can use ELASTIC BEANSTALK as a beginner.
7.) You have to create a cloud MOngoDB from MOngoDB official website.
